## 1 &nbsp;&nbsp; About

The cryptography utility provides users with a suite of cryptographic tools that's intended
to make cryptography processes both quicker and easier to utilise in a command-line environment.

&nbsp;
#### 3.1 &nbsp; Active Goals

The following outlines what's currently being worked on and expected to roll out soon:

1. XOR Hashing (Cipher)
	* ability to hash a plain-text string, given a plain-text key, to obtain hashed (cipher) text
	* ability to hash a hashed (cipher) text, given a plain-text key, to obtain the original plain-text string
	* varying input/output modes:
		- ability to input a string literal or a file containing a string literal for both original text and key
		- ability to input a binary string or a file containing a binary string for original text only
		- ability to output a string literal or a file containing a string literal for both original text and hashed text
		- ability to output a binary string or a file containing a binary string for both original text and hashed text


&nbsp;
#### 3.2 &nbsp; Future Plans

The following outlines what is planned to be developed, but is not currently being developed, in no particular order of expected completion:

1. MD5 Hashing
2. SHA Hashing
3. RIPEMD-160 Hashing
4. RSA Hashing/Encryption
5. AES Encryption
6. Blowfish Encryption
